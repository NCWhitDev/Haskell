*  We are making a Dart game. We need a function to determine the players points based on where they hit on the target board. 

* Checks *
If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.

The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), 
the middle circle a radius of 5 units, 
and the inner circle a radius of 1. 
Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are concentric defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its Cartesian coordinates x and y, where x and y are real), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.
